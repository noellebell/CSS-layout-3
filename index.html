			<p>Hello!</p>
			<p>This site is an initiative to encourage those all over the world to live a more eco-friendly—or as I like to say, eco-<em>loving</em>—lifestyle. Yes - that includes you. What many often do not realize is that even the smallest of choices has impact. Learn how these choices can better the world while saving you money and energy in the process.</p>
			<p>Here I like promote taking it <em>one step at a time</em>. If everyone on Earth just took one small step towards better living, we would live in a much healthier world. This site offers information, suggestions and comparative analysis that helps you, the user, make these not-so-difficult steps. In the end, it is up to you. Take it at your pace. I am just here to help.</p>
			<h2>How It Started</h2>
			<p>It was not until recently I came across Lauren Singer's TEDx speech that shook my world. I thought I had always lived an eco-friendly life, but when I heard her story, I realized just how much more I could do.</p>
			<blockquote>
				“I would never tell anyone how to live their life. But I'd like to show everyone that there are options.” -- Lauren Singer
			</blockquote>(Check out her blog Trash is for Tossers <a href="http://www.trashisfortossers.com/">here</a>!)
			<p>But not everyone can live zero waste right away. That is how I came up with OneStep, a friendly guide that shows how you can gradually adapt in a way that does not disrupt your routine. In fact, you’ll hardly notice… besides feeling happier.</p>
			<p>So please, join me. I promise it will be a piece of cake.</p>
